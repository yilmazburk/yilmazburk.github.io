<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
<p>
This documents outlines your rights and the conditions under which you are permitted to use Magic AI images in personal and commercial settings. <br>
Unless otherwise noted, these conditions are the same for images you find on and images that you create with Magic AI. <br>
These conditions will depend on your plan type and team size, so please read the following details carefully.</p>
<br>
<h2>Rights you give you Magic AI</h2>

By using the Magic AI, you grant to Magic AI a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display and sublicense images you create with Magic AI and prompts you input into Magic AI. In short, we need full rights to content on Magic AI so that we can run our service and sublicense to other users according to the conditions below.

Personal usage

Anyone can use Magic AI images for free for personal use. We define personal use as usage of Magic AI images within a project that is not monetized in any way. Examples include a personal website, video without advertising, or print to hang on your wall. Magic AI grants you a license to use images under the Creative Commons Noncommercial 4.0 Attribution International License. You can view the details of that license here.

Commercial usage

You must have a paid Magic AI plan to use Magic AI images commercially. We define commercial use as usage of Magic AI images within a project that is monetized, such as a company website, video with advertising, or physical product.

In order to qualify for commercial use you must have the correct plan for your team size. The Starter plan gives commercial rights if you are an individual creator. The Pro plan gives commercial rights to teams of 2-5 people. The Max plan gives commercial rights to teams of 5 or more people.

You cannot sell or sublicense Magic AI images on stock photo sites or other marketplaces unless you are the original creator of that image using the Magic AI image generator. While you can incorporate images found on Magic AI into commercial products, the right to sell images directly is limited to the creator. Upscaling an existing image on Magic AI does not count as creating that image, and its rights still belong to the original creator. This is meant to avoid confusion around multiple people selling the same image.

It's important to note that only images created under the Max plan are private. Images created under the Free, Pro, and Starter plans will show up in Magic AI search and other Magic AI users may also use them in personal and commercial settings. If you'd like to be the only person with a commercial license to an image then you must create that image while subscribed to the Max plan.

Stable Diffusion

The majority of images on Magic AI were created with the Magic AI Aperture model and the above license only applies to these images. We also have a selection of images created with the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model. These images are CC0 licensed and you can use them commercially without a paid plan. Click any image on the site to view its model info.
